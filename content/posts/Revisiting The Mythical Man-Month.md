+++
Fred Brooks's *The Mythical Man-Month*, originally published in 1974, is now over 50 years old. Heck, I bought my copy in 1994 and it already seemed ancient then! So I thought it would be interesting to re-read it and view it in the context of more than half a century of progress. I was pleasantly surprised. I was also delighted, infuriated, and inspired. There are fundamental truths about software engineering here, as well as comforting, timeless humanistic elements. There are also facepalm-inducing lessons that the profession seems to relearn every decade or that we still haven't fully internalized.

Here's a quick rundown of my takeaways, but I highly recommend anyone building software products today--architects, engineers, product managers, project managers, leadership--to give this book some of your time:

| Essay                                       | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| _The Tar Pit_                               | Software engineering encompasses much more than just coding, and when we neglect all the activities outside of coding, we massively underestimate the resources we'll need to deliver a product.               | Brooks's observations have held up: the cost of delivering a software product is dominated by assets and activities other than coding. Think infrastructure, DevOps, security, internationalization, documentation, testing, and support. There are also broad parallels across multiple disciplines, and the four-square framework is a useful mental model for understanding how and when to invest resources. |
| *The Mythical Man-Month*                    | Adding people to a project that's already late will only make it more late.                                                                                                                                    | Brooks’s Law, that adding people to a late project makes it later, is rooted in the fundamental physics of collaboration. The communication and coordination overhead he described remains an immutable challenge, regardless of advancements in tools or methodologies.                                                                                                                                         |
| *The Surgical Team*                         | A small, sharp team can maximize the effectiveness of the most experienced software engineers.                                                                                                                 | Recent generations seem to believe that small teams (e.g. "two-pizza" teams and Scrum teams) represent useful innovations, but this insight was already established in 1974. Brooks's specific model is an interesting case study, though, because technological advances have changed how we would structure a small team today.                                                                                |
| *Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design* | Successful system design requires a balance between the vision of a single architect (aristocracy) and the contributions of a collaborative team (democracy).                                                  | Conceptual integrity still requires that a design fit into as few brains a possible. Today we imbue roles like Product Manager and Architect with different aspects of that responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *The Second-System Effect*                  | The second system a designer creates is especially prone to over-engineering and feature bloat due to the designer’s newfound confidence and desire to include everything they couldn’t in their first system. | Brooks identified a universal truth about human ambition: early in a career, the mix of arrogance and immaturity often leads to over-engineering and overreach in a designer’s “second system.” This dynamic persists across disciplines, as people naturally strive to improve on what they’ve seen and make their own mark on the world.                                                                       |
| *Passing the Word*                          | Clear documentation is key to transferring knowledge and maintaining a shared understanding.                                                                                                                   | Much of this follows from "Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design", because, as much as we want the design to fit in as few brains as possible, those brains still need to transmit the design to others working on it. We haven't radically improved on the things Brooks has written about--if you squint, you can see things like "daily standups" and "technical debt" in this essay.                     |
| *Why Did the Tower of Babel Fail?*          | The Tower of Babel failed due to communication challenge that led to an inability to coordinate.                                                                                                               | This is a catalog of essential project management artifacts and an argument for the inherent value in project management itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| *Calling the Shot*                          | Estimation is hard.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Estimation is still hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Ten Pounds in a Five-Pound Sack*           | Designing software within the constraints of memory and storage requires thoughtful budgeting, as resources are never truly unlimited.                                                                         | This is a useful glimpse at a different era of computing, but almost irrelevant today. Storage and memory costs are still nonzero, but they're in the noise for most software projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| *The Documentary Hypothesis*                | Effective engineering management relies on specific key documents that capture requirements, plans, and progress, serving as the backbone of coordination and accountability                                   | This should be required reading for first-time managers. The specifics don't matter so much as the blunt, concrete description of what management work actually is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *Plan to Throw One Away*                    | The first version of any complex system is likely to be flawed, so it’s wise to plan for it to be discarded and replaced with a better-designed second version.                                                | Prototypes and models are an important way to de-risk an engineering project. Today we talk about sprints and iterations, but the motivation is the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Sharp Tools*                               | Skilled engineers need the right tools to be effective, but creating and maintaining these tools requires careful investment and balance to avoid wasting resources.                                           | Effective tools are still critical to engineering success, but today's landscape is populated by highly standardized and commoditized tools, instead of the bespoke editors and debuggers of the 1960s and 1970s.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| *The Whole and the Parts*                   | This is a catalog of approaches to ensuring correct program behavior.                                                                                                                                          | Whether or not software functions as desired (as opposed to as designed) is ultimately the most important aspect of software engineering. Most of what Brooks has listed is still visible in today's practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Hatching a Catastrophe*                    | "How does a project get to be a year late? One day at a time."                                                                                                                                                 | The situations and frustrations Brooks describes will be familiar to experienced professionals. Massive schedule slips are usually due to the compounding of small problems rather than a single disastrous eventy.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *The Other Face*                            | Systems should be designed and expressed in ways that prioritize clarity for engineers.                                                                                                                        | *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* echoed this sentiment 10 years later: "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." Jupyter and other computational notebooks are further evidence that Brooks was onto something.                                                                                                                       |

Some of these carry more weight than others, and in the series of articles that follows, I'll explore them in detail. But the first essay I want to dive deep on wasn't in the 1974 edition of the book. It's "No Silver Bullet--Essence and Accident", published in 1986, which argues that there would be no single development in the following decade which would provide a 10x improvement in software engineering effectiveness. Was he right? We've had almost three decades to find out, during which we've seen the rise of agile methodologies, cloud computing, CI/CD, and AI. How much have we really moved the needle? I'll take a look at essence and accident, not just as a way to evaluate our progress, but also to illuminate the essays in the book.
