On January 12 there was a magnitude 6.2 earthquake near Michoacan, Mexico. A little over 8 minutes later and 2500 km away, my [Raspberry Shake](https://raspberryshake.org/) in Atlanta detected it! You can see the earthquake arrive just after 8:41 AM UTC in the waveform (top chart) and spectrogram (middle chart). You can also see the Earth continue to ring in the spectrogram, as the low-frequencies continue for almost an hour.
